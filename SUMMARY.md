### Takeaways

We learned about the various kinds of noise in regression and how measurement noise is modeled using a gaussian distribution. We use MLE to find parameters which define our "mean" regression lines. We learnt how sampling gets mixed up with this, and how samples may be generated by drawing from the likelihood as a predictive distribution on y.
